/// StoreKit / Play Billing connection via in_app_purchase. Queries the

/// *** Purchase validation approach — resolved in project discussion ***
/// No backend receipt-validation call. This was a real trade-off, not a
/// default: Section 1 mandates zero backend for sync, but that's not the
/// same claim as "no backend ever" — a validation server was genuinely
/// considered and rejected on its actual merits, not on the document's
/// say-so. Reasoning: on iOS, in_app_purchase v3.3 defaults to StoreKit2,
/// which performs real on-device cryptographic signature verification of
/// the transaction JWS before the app ever sees it as valid — this is not
/// blind client trust, a non-jailbroken device cannot fake a purchase this
/// way. On Android, Play Billing's purchase token is somewhat weaker
/// without server confirmation, but the value protected is $0.99/month —
/// server-side validation earns its engineering cost on high-value
/// unlocks, not a dollar-a-month ad-removal toggle where the realistic
/// fraud population (people rooting/jailbreaking specifically to dodge
/// $1/mo) is close to financially irrelevant at this app's scale.
///
/// [verifyPurchase] is intentionally the single seam where a future
/// server call could be inserted (e.g. a Cloudflare Worker, given
/// Cloudflare is already in use for website/ per Section 5) without
/// touching any other method in this class, if fraud data or revenue
/// ever justifies revisiting this decision.
