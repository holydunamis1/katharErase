/// Extreme fallback: device has <1GB RAM or no camera. Honest message +
/// manual import instructions.
///
/// *** RAM CHECK — NOT IMPLEMENTED, flagged honestly rather than faked ***
/// Checked live during Phase 9: Flutter's own GitHub tracker
/// (flutter/flutter#68181) confirms the mainstream, verified-publisher
/// `device_info_plus` plugin does NOT expose actual device RAM size —
/// it's an open, unimplemented feature request. The packages that do
/// claim to expose RAM (`ram_info`, `system_info_plus`, `memory_info`)
/// are all small, low-adoption packages with no verified publisher — a
/// different trust tier than every other dependency added during this
/// build (permission_handler/baseflow.com, url_launcher/flutter.dev,
/// crop_your_image/tsuyoshichujo.com, flutter_image_compress/
/// fluttercandies.com). Adding an unverified-publisher plugin just to
/// satisfy this one checkbox was rejected on the same reasoning as the
/// IAP backend decision earlier in this build: low benefit for a real
/// dependency-risk cost. If RAM detection is wanted later, evaluate a
/// specific package on its own merits then — this screen's [reason]
/// enum already has a slot ready for it (RAM check would set
/// UnsupportedReason.lowMemory once a trustworthy source for that value
/// exists).
///
/// What IS implemented: camera-absence detection, using the already-
/// present `camera` package's availableCameras() — no new dependency,
/// no trust-tier compromise.
